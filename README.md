# DrinkMixerRobot
This was code written for a drink mixer robot. I collaborated to design and build a robot that was capable of mixing and serving drinks similar to a bartender. The code is written in Robotc which is a hybrid between C and C++, specifically meant for VEX, Lego Mindstorm and Arduino robots. 

It implements a user interface as well as drink mixing and serving capabilities using an event-driven algorithm.
